The easy way to get real world data into your app
=================================================

<br/>

Getting started
---------------

1. Plug your sensor wires into HEINS
2. Connect HEINS over Ethernet to your computer.
3. Power on
4. Send a REST-API-request or subscribe to the HEINS internal MQ-Server

Done! Now you can start creating your own awesome app!

Vision
------

Our vision is to give software developers an easy device in their hands so they can connect their apps to the real world in a very easy way.


Features
--------

HEINS - Small I/O-Device under Open Hardware licence 

- to allocate up to 10 digital or analog signals, voltage level from 0 V up to 24 VDC

- Industrial terminal connectors for each sensor, power supply included (signal, Vcc and GND)

- to get these data from HEINS into your computer over a REST-API

- to subscribe these data from the HEINS internal MQ-Server using the MQTT-protocol

- to publish these data from HEINS to an external MQ-Server, i.e. cloud service
